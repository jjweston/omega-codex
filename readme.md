# Omega Codex

Omega Codex is an AI-powered assistant that helps you explore, understand, and develop software projects.
It aims to support software developers by
automating tedious tasks,
answering project-specific questions, and
contributing meaningfully to the development process,
all while integrating tightly with version control and issue tracking platforms like GitHub.

## Early Development

> [!WARNING]
> Omega Codex is in early development and should be considered a prototype or proof of concept.
> It is not yet ready for general use.
> Expect incomplete features, experimental ideas, and frequent iteration.

The current early development goal for Omega Codex is to develop a minimal functional implementation
that is able to ingest basic information about a GitHub project into a vectorized knowledge base,
allow a user to make a query about the project,
use Retrieval Augmented Generation to send the userâ€™s query
along with relevant portions of the project to the ChatGPT API,
and display the ChatGPT API response to the user.

## Development Process

Although Omega Codex is currently a one-person project,
it is being developed using a collaborative, team-oriented workflow.
Each feature or idea is tracked as a GitHub issue,
and changes are implemented through topic branches and pull requests.
This workflow has been intentionally chosen to:

- Generate realistic issue and pull request data that Omega Codex will eventually analyze and learn from.
- Simulate real-world team collaboration, enabling more robust development and testing of Omega Codex's capabilities.
- Explore and validate how Omega Codex can be used in complex projects with structured workflows.

## Prerequisites

Omega Codex is primarily written in Java but also uses Python for some tasks.
It also uses the OpenAI API and Qdrant.

### Java

You need a Java JDK and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build and run Omega Codex.
We use the [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/) Java JDK, but other JDKs may also work.

Omega Codex works with following versions, but other versions may also work:

- Eclipse Temurin:
  - `25+36-LTS`
- Apache Maven:
  - `3.9.11`

### Python

You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to run Omega Codex.

Omega Codex works with following versions, but other versions may also work:

- Python:
    - `3.13.7`
- Poetry:
    - `2.2.0`

Ensure that your Python dependencies are installed and updated before running Omega Codex.
Run the following in the `python-tools` directory:

```bash
poetry sync
```

### OpenAI API

To use Omega Codex you'll need an [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) key.

If you use an API key with *Restricted* permissions you must grant *Write* permission to the following resources:
- Model Capabilities
- Responses API

### Qdrant

You need a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) database to run Omega Codex.

We provide instructions for running Qdrant in a Docker container, but other options are available,
such as [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-quickstart/).

Ensure that [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed before proceeding.

Qdrant images are available from Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/qdrant/qdrant

To download or update the Qdrant Docker image: `docker pull qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.2`

To create a Docker container for Qdrant:

```bash
docker create --name qdrant \
    -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v qdrant-storage:/qdrant/storage \
    qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.2
```

This command does the following:

* Assigns the name `qdrant` to the container (`--name`).
* Opens network port 6333 for the Qdrant REST API (`-p`).
* Opens network port 6334 for the Qdrant gRPC API (`-p`).
* Attaches the `qdrant-storage` volume to `/qdrant/storage` for storing Qdrant's data (`-v`).

To start the Qdrant Docker container: `docker start qdrant`

Verify Qdrant is running by checking its web interface
(replace `qdrant-host` with the hostname or IP of your Qdrant database):
http://qdrant-host:6333/dashboard

To stop the Qdrant Docker container: `docker stop qdrant`

To remove the Qdrant Docker container: `docker rm qdrant`

Removing the Qdrant Docker container does not remove the `qdrant-storage` volume.

To remove the `qdrant-storage` volume: `docker volume rm qdrant-storage`

## Configuration

Omega Codex requires the following environment variables to be set:

* `OMEGACODEX_OPENAI_API_KEY` : Your OpenAI API key.
* `OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_HOST` : The host name or IP address of your Qdrant database.
* `OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_GRPC_PORT` : The gRPC port of your Qdrant database, most likely `6334`.

We use [dotenv-java](https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java)
to allow environment variables to be specified in a file.
To do so, create filed called `.env` in your project root directory with the following:

```env
OMEGACODEX_OPENAI_API_KEY=openai-api-key
OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_HOST=qdrant-host
OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_GRPC_PORT=qdrant-grpc-port
```

Replace the values with settings appropriate for your environment.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not commit `.env` to Git.
> Doing so will leak sensitive information.

## Building and Running

To build Omega Codex, and run the unit tests: `mvn package`

To run the integration tests: `mvn verify`

To run the *Embedding* proof of concept: `mvn exec:java -P embed`

To run the *Markdown Split* proof of concept: `mvn exec:java -P split`
