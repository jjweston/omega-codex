# Omega Codex

*Omega Codex* is an AI-powered assistant that helps you explore, understand, and develop software projects.
It aims to support software developers by
automating tedious tasks,
answering project-specific questions, and
contributing meaningfully to the development process,
all while integrating tightly with version control and issue tracking platforms like GitHub.

## ðŸš§ Early Development ðŸš§

**This project is in early development and should be considred a prototype or proof of concept.
It is not yet ready for general use.
Expect incomplete features, experimental ideas, and frequent iteration.**

## Development Process

Although Omega Codex is currently a one-person project,
it is being developed using a collaborative, team-oriented workflow.
Each feature or idea is tracked as a GitHub issue,
and changes are implemented through topic branches and pull requests.
This workflow has been intentionally chosen to:

- Generate realistic issue and pull request data that Omega Codex will eventually analyze and learn from.
- Simulate real-world team collaboration, enabling more robust development and testing of Omega Codex's capabilities.
- Explore and validate how Omega Codex can be used in complex projects with structured workflows.
