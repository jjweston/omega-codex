# Omega Codex

Omega Codex is an AI-powered assistant that helps you explore, understand, and develop software projects.
It aims to support software developers by
automating tedious tasks,
answering project-specific questions, and
contributing meaningfully to the development process,
all while integrating tightly with version control and issue tracking platforms like GitHub.

## Early Development

> [!WARNING]
> Omega Codex is in early development and should be considered a prototype or proof of concept.
> It is not yet ready for general use.
> Expect incomplete features, experimental ideas, and frequent iteration.

The current early development goal for Omega Codex is to develop a minimal functional implementation
that is able to ingest basic information about a GitHub project into a vectorized knowledge base,
allow a user to make a query about the project,
use Retrieval Augmented Generation to send the userâ€™s query
along with relevant portions of the project to the ChatGPT API,
and display the ChatGPT API response to the user.

## Development Process

Although Omega Codex is currently a one-person project,
it is being developed using a collaborative, team-oriented workflow.
Each feature or idea is tracked as a GitHub issue,
and changes are implemented through topic branches and pull requests.
This workflow has been intentionally chosen to:

- Generate realistic issue and pull request data that Omega Codex will eventually analyze and learn from.
- Simulate real-world team collaboration, enabling more robust development and testing of Omega Codex's capabilities.
- Explore and validate how Omega Codex can be used in complex projects with structured workflows.

## Configuration

To use Omega Codex you'll need an OpenAI API key.

If you use an API key with *Restricted* permissions
you must ensure that your API key has *Request* permission to the *Model capabilities* resource.
This is required for calling the *embeddings* API endpoint.

Once you have your OpenAI API key you must configure it in Omega Codex
by creating a file called `.env` in your project root directory with the following:

```env
OMEGACODEX_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not commit your `.env` file.
> It is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

Omega Codex is primarily written in Java but also uses Python for some tasks.

### Java

You need a Java JDK and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build and run Omega Codex.

### Python

You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to run Omega Codex.

Before running Omega Codex you must install Python dependencies.
In the `python-tools` directory, run: `poetry install`

## Building and Running

To build Omega Codex: `mvn package`

To run the *Embedding* proof of concept: `mvn exec:java -P embed`

To run the *Markdown Split* proof of concept: `mvn exec:java -P split`
