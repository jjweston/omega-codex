# Omega Codex

Omega Codex is an AI-powered assistant that helps you explore, understand, and develop software projects.
It aims to support software developers by
automating tedious tasks,
answering project-specific questions, and
contributing meaningfully to the development process,
all while integrating tightly with version control and issue tracking platforms like GitHub.

## Early Development

> [!WARNING]
> Omega Codex is in early development and should be considered a prototype or proof of concept.
> It is not yet ready for general use.
> Expect incomplete features, experimental ideas, and frequent iteration.

The current early development goal for Omega Codex is to develop a minimal functional implementation
that is able to ingest basic information about a GitHub project into a vectorized knowledge base,
allow a user to make a query about the project,
use Retrieval Augmented Generation to send the user’s query
along with relevant portions of the project to the ChatGPT API,
and display the ChatGPT API response to the user.

## Development Process

Although Omega Codex is currently a one-person project,
it is being developed using a collaborative, team-oriented workflow.
Each feature or idea is tracked as a GitHub issue,
and changes are implemented through topic branches and pull requests.
This workflow has been intentionally chosen to:

- Generate realistic issue and pull request data that Omega Codex will eventually analyze and learn from.
- Simulate real-world team collaboration, enabling more robust development and testing of Omega Codex's capabilities.
- Explore and validate how Omega Codex can be used in complex projects with structured workflows.

## Prerequisites

Omega Codex is primarily written in Java but also uses Python for some tasks.
It also uses the OpenAI API and Qdrant.

### Java

You need a Java JDK and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build and run Omega Codex.
We use the [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/) Java JDK, but other JDKs may also work.

Omega Codex works with following versions, but other versions may also work:

- Eclipse Temurin:
  - `25.0.1+8-LTS`
- Apache Maven:
  - `3.9.12`

### Python

You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to run Omega Codex.

Omega Codex works with following versions, but other versions may also work:

- Python:
    - `3.14.2`
- Poetry:
    - `2.2.1`

Ensure that your Python dependencies are installed and updated before running Omega Codex.
Run the following in the `python-tools` directory:

```bash
poetry sync
```

### OpenAI API

To use Omega Codex you'll need an [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) key.

If you use an API key with *Restricted* permissions you must grant *Write* permission to the following resources:
- Model Capabilities
- Responses API

### Qdrant

You need a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) database to run Omega Codex.

We provide instructions for running Qdrant in a Docker container, but other options are available,
such as [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-quickstart/).

Ensure that [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed before proceeding.

Qdrant images are available from Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/qdrant/qdrant

To download or update the Qdrant Docker image: `docker pull qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.2`

To create a Docker container for Qdrant:

```bash
docker create --name qdrant \
    -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v qdrant-storage:/qdrant/storage \
    qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.2
```

This command does the following:

* Assigns the name `qdrant` to the container (`--name`).
* Opens network port 6333 for the Qdrant REST API (`-p`).
* Opens network port 6334 for the Qdrant gRPC API (`-p`).
* Attaches the `qdrant-storage` volume to `/qdrant/storage` for storing Qdrant's data (`-v`).

To start the Qdrant Docker container: `docker start qdrant`

Verify Qdrant is running by checking its web interface
(replace `qdrant-host` with the hostname or IP of your Qdrant database):
http://qdrant-host:6333/dashboard

To stop the Qdrant Docker container: `docker stop qdrant`

To remove the Qdrant Docker container: `docker rm qdrant`

Removing the Qdrant Docker container does not remove the `qdrant-storage` volume.

To remove the `qdrant-storage` volume: `docker volume rm qdrant-storage`

## Configuration

Omega Codex requires the following environment variables to be set:

* `OMEGACODEX_OPENAI_API_KEY` : Your OpenAI API key.
* `OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_HOST` : The host name or IP address of your Qdrant database.
* `OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_GRPC_PORT` : The gRPC port of your Qdrant database, most likely `6334`.

We use [dotenv-java](https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java)
to allow environment variables to be specified in a file.
To do so, create filed called `.env` in your project root directory with the following:

```env
OMEGACODEX_OPENAI_API_KEY=openai-api-key
OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_HOST=qdrant-host
OMEGACODEX_QDRANT_GRPC_PORT=qdrant-grpc-port
```

Replace the values with settings appropriate for your environment.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not commit `.env` to Git.
> Doing so will leak sensitive information.

## Building and Running

To build Omega Codex, and run the unit tests: `mvn package`

To run the integration tests: `mvn verify`

To run the *Graphical Query Interface*: `mvn javafx:run`

To run the *Command-Line Query Interface*: `mvn exec:exec`

To run the *Embedding* proof of concept: `mvn exec:exec -P embed`

To run the *Markdown Split* proof of concept: `mvn exec:exec -P split`

To run the *Qdrant* proof of concept: `mvn exec:exec -P qdrant`
